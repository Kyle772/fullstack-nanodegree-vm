fullstack-nanodegree-vm
=============

Common code for the Relational Databases and Full Stack Fundamentals courses


This is the logs analysis project. 

To run the code:
    vagrant up
    cd /vagrant
    python queries.py .
    
The code outputs based off of the three following questions on the project divided by gaps

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time? 
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

I left question 3 in datetime/decimal format because that is easier to work with for when I decide to play with this sql database some more

Thanks for checking it out!
